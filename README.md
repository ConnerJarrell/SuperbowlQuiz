# SuperbowlQuiz

For this homemowrk, we will be creating a quiz using javascript.

I decided to use a football theme as it has been quite a while since any sports hve been played due to COVID.

I started off with code very similiar to most people in the class and switched it up halfway through.

I am now using a quiz format similiar to using bootstrap almost.

Still needs work on coding how to submit your Name and log for scores.
